= JSMock - JavaScript Mock Object Library

== About
	Author: Justin DeWind <dewindj@gmail.com>
	Version: 1.2.2
	License: Copyright 2007 by Justin DeWind
					 Released under the LGPL license.

== Usage
	-Example:
		mock = new mockControl(MyObject);

		mock.expects().doThat("hello");
		mock.expects().doThis("world").andReturn("foo");

		mock.doThat("hello");
		mock.doThis("world");

		mockControl.verify();
	
	-Mixin Example:
	  JSMock.extend(this);
	  mock = createMock(MyObject);
	  
	  mock.expects().doThat();
	  
	  mock.doThat();
	  
	  verifyMocks();
	  
  Usage Notes:
	  -Mocking the document and window object is not consistent from browser to browser
	  -Verification happens automatically on tearDown, so manually calling verifyMocks should not be         
     required when JSMock is mixed in.
